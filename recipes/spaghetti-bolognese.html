        <strong>Everyone</strong> needs a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine!
    </p>
    <p> 
        The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour.
        It is perfect for a quick midweek meal but even better if you can simmer it for a couple of hours!
        Serve it over pasta, stuff into jacket potatoes, make an epic Lasagna or Baked Spaghetti Pie!

        Steps in making the Spaghetti:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Saute garlic and onion for about 3 minutes;</li>
        <li>Brown the beef about 2 minutes;</li>
        <li>Add everything else, give it a good stir then simmer for 20 minutes minimum (midweek),
            up to 3 hours (weekend indulgence!). Slow cooking makes the beef incredibly tender and the sauce develops extra flavour.
        </li>
