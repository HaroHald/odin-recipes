    <p>This is a Mac and Cheese recipe that is everything you want in a knock-your-socks off Macaroni Cheese,
    cheesy and creamy, with perfectly cooked macaroni (no bloated pasta!),
    plenty of sauce and a crunchy buttery top (essential in my world!)
    </p>
    <p>This may be a pretty plain dish but its easy to makes,
    and it is done within a short time.
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>

        <p>Steps in making the mac and cheese:</p>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta: Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add macaroni and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.</li>   
        <li>Toss in butter: Drain, return pasta to pot, add butter and toss until melted. Set aside to cool while making the Sauce</li>   
        <li>Mix together Topping. Set aside.</li>   
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (all oven types).</li> 
        <li>Make roux: In a large saucepan or in an ovenproof skillet (I use my 26cm/9" Lodge cast iron skillet), melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add milk: Add about 1 cup of the milk and mix to dissolve the paste into the milk. Then add remaining milk and mix until lump free (use whisk if required).</li>    
        <li>Add Seasonings: Mix in salt and Seasonings if using.</li> 
        <li>Thicken sauce: Cook, stirring/whisking regularly, for 5 to 8 minutes until thickened to a cream consistency. When the Sauce coats the back of a wooden spoon, you should be able to draw a path with your finger.</li> 
        <li>Add cheese: Remove from stove, add cheese and stir. The cheese doesn't need to melt.</li> 
        <li>Check salt: Adjust salt to taste (if you use recommended cheeses, you won't need more).</li>
        <li>Assemble: Pour Sauce into pot with Macaroni. Stir quickly, then pour back into the skillet (I did this) or a baking dish (Note 4). Sprinkle with breadcrumb topping.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes or until top is light golden. Don't bake too long otherwise you'll bake away the Sauce!</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve immediately! I sprinkled mine with a bit of fresh parsley. See notes for best make-ahead method.</li>
    </ol>
